## Overview Project
Reminder App is a final project developed as part of the Basic Programming course. The aim of this project is to apply the basic programming concepts learned during the course. In this project, students are expected to be able to apply programming principles such as the use of variables, repetition, use of functions, and data management in the Python programming language.

By developing a "Reminder App", students can practice building simple applications using the Django framework and implementing basic functions such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
